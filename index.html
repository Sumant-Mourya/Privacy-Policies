<h1>Privacy Policy for Dialer</h1>
<div class="updated">Last updated: February 6, 2026</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Dialer ("we", "our", or "the app") is a phone dialer application developed by Amigo.
        This Privacy Policy explains how information is used and protected when you use our app.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dialer processes most data locally on your device. Some limited data may be collected
        by third-party services such as Google AdMob, as described below.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Fake Call Feature</h2>
    <p>
        The Fake Call feature allows you to simulate an incoming call for personal use.
        Fake calls are generated locally on your device and do not contact real phone numbers,
        emergency services, or external systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        This feature is clearly labeled within the app and is intended for entertainment or
        privacy purposes only.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        Dialer operates primarily as an offline application. We do not collect, transmit,
        or store your personal data on any external servers.
    </p>
    <p>The app accesses the following data locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Contacts</strong> – To display contact names, phone numbers, and photos</li>
        <li><strong>Call Logs</strong> – To show your recent call history</li>
        <li><strong>Phone State</strong> – To manage incoming and outgoing calls</li>
        <li><strong>SMS</strong> – To send auto-reply and quick reply messages when enabled</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        None of this data is transmitted to our servers or to any third party by the app itself.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Microphone & Audio Usage</h2>
    <p>
        Dialer requires microphone access to enable live call audio routing during phone calls.
        The microphone is used only while you are actively on a call.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dialer does <strong>not</strong> record, store, process, or transmit any audio.
        All call audio is handled directly by the Android system and your device hardware.
    </p>
    <p>
        No call audio is saved locally or shared with any server or third party.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        Dialer uses Google AdMob to display rewarded advertisements.

        </a>
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not have access to or control over the data collected by Google AdMob.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">

        Advertisements are never shown during active phone calls, incoming call screens,
        or over the lock screen.

        or configuration screens.

    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Advertisements</h2>
    <p>
        Dialer uses Google AdMob rewarded ads to support development.
        Ads are shown only when you choose to unlock certain premium features.
    </p>
    <p>
        If ads fail to load, features are unlocked after multiple attempts.
        We do not show intrusive or forced ads.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Dialer is not directed at children under the age of 13.
        We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
        We take reasonable measures to protect data stored on your device.
        Since all app data remains local, security depends on your device’s
        system protections such as lock screen and encryption.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
        Any changes will be reflected with an updated “Last updated” date.
    </p>
</div>
